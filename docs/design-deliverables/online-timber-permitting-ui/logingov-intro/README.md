# Preparing users for login.gov
Frontliners verify users' identity when they go through the firewood permit purchase process. The team has explored login.gov for handling identity verification online. To verifiy identity on login.gov, users must create an account (authorization) and then verify their identity (identity proofing) on the login.gov website. 

The login.gov process looks and feels different from Open Forest, so we wanted to explore how to best introduce login.gov to users. We want to:
* Communicate that login.gov is a trusted government resource that is used by the Forest Service
* Prepare users to see login.gov in their firewood permit journey
* Inform users of what they'll need to complete the login.gov user flow

[We looked at how other login.gov partners introduce login.gov, and saw divergent approaches](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1576856402736/51bd7ea20e81b6a87e698a91e27cb342bb425064). Some mentioned login.gov by name, others gave no indication that the user would go to a different website.

We experimented with different button styles that would preview login.gov branding before users are redirected to a new website.
