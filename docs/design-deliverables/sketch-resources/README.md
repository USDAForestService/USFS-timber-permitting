# Timber permitting sketch resources

This is the home for the sketch files we used to develop our initial timber permitting prototypes. These sketch files use the latest [USWDS 2 sketch resources](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/designers/), and have been adapted when needed to reflect the [U.S Forest Service's design system](https://nciinc.github.io/fs-fork-uswds-site/).

## Libraries
* `USFS-colors` This file pulls in the palette defined by the [U.S Forest Service design system's color guidance](https://nciinc.github.io/fs-fork-uswds-site/components/colors/).
* `uswds-block` USWDS block is a simple multipurpose symbol for all kinds of design tasks. It makes it easy to build nested symbols with commonly needed overrides like background-color, border-width and border radius.
